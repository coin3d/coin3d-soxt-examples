Coin3D examples using the SoXt GUI

The coin3d-soxt-examples project provides examples for Open Inventor programming using the Coin 3D SDK and SoXt toolkit.
These examples were tested against older versions of Coin and SoXt and may not be relavent to the current state of the
Coin 3D libraries.

A more comprehensive collection of examples may be found at [ivexamples](https://github.com/coin3d/ivexamples), which
are kept up to date with the latest Coin and SoXt technology.
